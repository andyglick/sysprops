sysprops
========

Sysprops is a simple application to print out Java System and Environment properties.

Why?
=======
You could ask why would you share this stupid app with the world?
Then answer is simple: otherwise I have to write it again every time and if I keep it on USB sticks I usually loose them.

For those, like me, who always forget the wide range of keys that the System Properties contain this will help you to quickly print them to System.out.

How to Run?
=======
Import it in your IDE and run it there.

I'll maybe add main-class to the jar manifest later.


Have Fun
