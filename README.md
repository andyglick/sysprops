sysprops
========

Sysprops is a simple application to print out Java System and Environment properties.

What's inside
=======
* A System and Environment Properties printer.
* A Locale printer, printing all available locales.
* A Charset printer, prints all available charsets.


Why?
=======
You could ask why would you share this stupid app with the world?
Then answer is simple: otherwise I have to write it again every time and if I keep it on USB sticks I usually loose them.

For those, like me, who always forget the wide range of keys that the System Properties contain this will help you to quickly print them to System.out. Or to see if needed charset and locale is available to Java.


How to Run?
=======
Import it in your IDE and run it there. Or run it as standalone java application. ( java -jar nameofjar ) You can add arguments to that to run a specific printer.


Have Fun
